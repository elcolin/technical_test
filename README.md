## Research
    Given a grid of height, return the shortest path from the point with height=0 to the point with height = 27.
    The path can only go to a new cell with an height at most one higher. No diagonals.
Based on this, I looked for an algorithm to find the shortest path without any diagonals.
I encountered the BFS algorithm

Searching for best container (queue because of dequeue and enqueue, good time complexity)

## Types of error

    No S or E
    overflow

# Grid Shortest Path
